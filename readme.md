# Sample of HTML/CSS/JS UI with Excalibur

This is an example of how to build vanilla html/css/js UIs with Excalibur code. The main gist is to put an HTML layer above the canvas layer and use that for UI.

This can be adapted to any frontend framework/library you prefer.

See excalibur docs for more explanation https://excaliburjs.com/docs/html
